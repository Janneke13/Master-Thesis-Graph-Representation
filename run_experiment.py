This file is used to run the model using input from the user. The user defines everything in the command line, after
which the program runs. If a certain parameter is not given, a default is used, which is mostly derived from the papers.

This is both for the classification models, and for the GAE model. Results are the files (or printed output), and
other output as given in the dictionary.
